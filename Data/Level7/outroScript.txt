s;Kayla;Ophie, it's time we had a little chat.{w}{br}I'm getting sick and tired of your constant harassment of Sam.{w};auto
s;Ophie;Huh?{w};auto
s;Kayla;You don't know the half of what Sam does for you and your country.{w}{br}He raised this Resistance from nothing.{w}{br}He's the only reason you have a bed to sleep on.{w}{br}So lay off!{w}{br}Sam might not stick up for himself, but I will.{w};auto
s;Ophie;...{w};auto
s;Kayla;Are we clear?{w};auto
s;Ophie;Yeah...{w};auto
s;Kayla;Great!{w}{br}I'm going to go help Sam look for the information.{w}{br}Keep your eyes open for any more reinforcements.{w}{br}Even in death, that commander may have left us some surprises.{w};auto

s;Prim;That outburst was unlike Kayla.{w}{br}I wonder what's gotten into her...{w};auto
u;Eliza;Right
s;Eliza;Pah. You're so funny sometimes.{w};auto
s;Prim;Huh?{w};auto
s;Eliza;You really haven't figured it out, yet?{w};auto
s;Prim;Figured what out yet?{w};auto
s;Eliza;Kayla's not just Sam's secret source.{w}{br}They're also secret... lovers.{w};auto
s;Prim;What! Really?{w};auto
s;Eliza;It's obvious.{w}{br}I mean, they do a decent job of hiding it,{w}{br}but can't you just feel the tension in the air?{w};auto
s;Prim;I guess...{w};auto
s;Eliza;Kayla just had enough of Ophie's ragging.{w}{br}He needs to learn some respect, and Sam is too kind to correct him.{w};auto
s;Prim;Oh...{w};auto
s;Eliza;Hee hee hee.{w}{br}You crack me up sometimes, Prim.{w};auto

s;Theo;Yes...?{w};auto
s;Prim;You know a lot about the Empire.{w};auto
s;Theo;Uh... well... I don't know if that's true.{w}{br}There's always more to learn.{w};auto
s;Prim;Well, do you know who that man was?{w};auto
s;Theo;He definitely didn't seem like one of the Duke's normal lieutenants.{w}{br}That ward he used signified that much.{w}{br}I would guess he was sent here on the Empress's orders.{w}{br}Whatever's in this information must be important...{w};auto

s;Vagnius;Marduk... has failed, milord.{w}{br}The Resistance lives.{w};auto
s;Ulver;Hmmph!{w};auto
s;Vagnius;But we were close this time, milord. So very, very close!{w}{br}Give me one more chance.{w};auto
s;Ulver;...{w}{br}What is your plan this time?{w};auto
s;Vagnius;The village of Podoma, milord.{w}{br}The Resistance will not ignore the feverish pleas of their own countrymen.{w}{br}I can draw them into the open and eliminate them once and for all.{w};auto
s;Ulver;How... ignoble.{w};auto
s;Vagnius;Milord?{w};auto
s;Ulver;Proceed with your plan, Vagnius.{w}{br}This is your last chance.{w};auto

s;Ulver;''To the strongest.''{w}{br}Is this not the way of the Empire, Adjutant?{w};auto
