    s;Sam;Are you almost ready, Kayla?
    s;Kayla;Tsk Tsk. A lady is ready precisely when she means to be, and no sooner.
    s;Sam;I see...
    s;Kayla;Hmmm... Is something wrong, dearest?
    s;Sam;No... Well, its nothing you said.
    s;Kayla;So?
    s;Sam;This is our last mission...
    s;Kayla;You worried we won't succeed?
    s;Sam;To be honest, I am a bit worried. Even you have your limits, Kayla. 
    s;Kayla;Haven't found them yet!
    s;Sam;Anyways, thats not really my chief concern. It's our last mission... together. When this is over we'll split ways. The Resistance will be disbanded. So, there won't be much of a reason for the two of us to be together.
    s;Kayla;Sam, say no more. You know my feelings toward you. Do you think I'll just leave?
    s;Sam;No, but we each have jobs, responsibilities, ambitions. Those too can strand us apart. I don't want to look back on today with any regrets. 
    s;Kayla;Nor do I.
    s;Sam;Well, then,{w}{br}after this is over... if we're both still...{w}{br}around.{w}{br}I'd like to make this fling official.
    bop;Kayla
    s;Kayla;Ah! A ring?
    s;Sam;I'd been meaning to give to you for a while...{w}{br}but I could never find the right time.{w}{br}So how 'bout it?
    s;Kayla;Of course!{w}{br}You've got me as giddy as a maid on her first dance.
    s;Sam;Phew!
    s;Kayla;You thought I'd turn you down?
    s;Sam;Never hurts to consider the possibilities.
    s;Kayla;Well, thank you dearest. ...You know we're not going to die out there.
    s;Sam;Hmmm...?
    s;Kayla;Between the two of us, nothing can stand in our way.

    s;Althea;Ah... greetings, Ophie.{w}{br}...You're already done with your preparations?
    s;Ophie;Yep. Honestly, I don't need to bring much. My trusty blade and some food go a long way. I like to travel light.
    s;Althea;Hmmm...
    s;Ophie;Althea?
    s;Althea;Oh, sorry Ophie. I was listening. I'm just having trouble fitting this all in one bag...
    s;Ophie;Let me take over.
    s;Althea;Oh-- If you insist.
    s;Ophie;I do.

    s;Althea;I-I'm not very uh... very practical, like you. Between my magic tomes, spare robes, potions and other draughts... it's quite the hassle... So thank you.
    s;Ophie;Oh, it's not hassle at all.
    s;Althea;Well, I admire your practicality. Growing up I never got the chance to learn how to cook or clean or sew like most girls. I really feel quite useless compared to Prim or Eliza.
    s;Ophie;There's always time to learn.
    s;Althea;I wouldn't want to burden them with teaching me. I'd make a fool of myself.
    set_expression;Ophie;Smiling
    s;Ophe;Nonsense. I'm sure Prim would be happy to teach you how to sew. And I'm a pretty good cook myself. I could give you a few pointers.
    set_expression;Althea;Smiling
    s;Althea;That'd be nice...
    set_expression;Ophie;Normal
    s;Ophie;Anyhow, Althea, you shouldn't be so down on yourself. You've got... uh... other strengths.
    s;Althea;Hmmm...?
    s;Ophie;I-I mean, you may not know how to sew,{w}{br}but you're levelheaded... and fair... and smart... I couldn't stand to read all these tomes.
    s;Althea;...Teehee. Thank you, Ophie. That makes me feel better.
    s;Ophie;Well, uh, I'm all done here... so I'd better get going... I'm sure someone else could use help.
    set_expression;Althea;Normal
    s;Althea;Wait, Ophie. Before you go...
    give_item;Ophie;Althea's Charm
    s;Ophie;Uh... thanks Althea. You sure you want to give this to me?
    s;Althea;Oh, its nothing. Take it.
    s;Ophie;Right...{w}{br}Well, I'll be off.
