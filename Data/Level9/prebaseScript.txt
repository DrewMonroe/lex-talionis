s;Renae;So what's the plan, Sam?{w};auto
s;Sam;If all goes well today, this'll be my last premission spiel.{w};auto
s;Renae;Thank the Sun King!{w};auto
s;Sam;...{w};auto
s;Renae;No offense.{w};auto
s;Sam;Sure...{w}{br}Well, its something for you to look forward to, Renae.{w}{br}Anyways, with Vagnius dead, there's only one obstacle left in our way.{w}{br}Archon Ulver himself.{w};auto
u;Kayla;MidRight
s;Kayla;Once he's been captured, and Althea takes the throne,{w}{br}Kerala will be independant once more.{w};auto
s;Sam;Everything we've dreamed of.{w}{br}Everything we've fought for.{w}{br}It all comes down to today.{w}{br}Kiley's army assaults the gates of Rajas at dawn.{w}{br}While the main Imperial garrison is occupied with that,{w}{br}we few will sneak into the Palace and capture or kill the Archon.{w};auto
s;Kayla;With their leader incapacitated, and Kerala rising up in rebellion around them,{w}{br}the remaining Imperials will be forced to surrender.{w}{br}You have the Confederacy's backing on this.{w};auto
s;Ophie;Okay... But how are we going to sneak in?{w}{br}Ulver has Rajas locked down tight.{w};auto
s;Sam;Luckily, Coyote knows the location of a secret passage below Rajas,{w}{br}built during the time of the Sun King.{w}{br}According to him, the passage leads directly to the Lion Throne.{w}{br}It's been so long since anyone's used it, I'm sure it'll be abandoned.{w}{br}At least, neither Theo nor I had heard of it before.{w};auto
s;Ophie;Well then, we don't have long.{w};auto
s;Sam;Quite right.{w}{br}Everyone, this is your last chance to prepare. Make it count.{w};auto
