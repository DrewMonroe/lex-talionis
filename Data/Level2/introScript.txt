s;Joel;The Resistance base is a just little yonder.{w}{clear}Normally I'd stop at the village here for supplies,{w}{br}but I think getting ya'll to the base takes precedence.{w};auto
s;Prim;Don't burden yourself on our account.{w};auto
s;Joel;Its no burden, lass...{w};auto
s;Ophie;So, what's the Resistance base like, anyway?
s;Joel;Well, lad, we'll be coming upon a waterfall soon...{w};auto

s;Ophie;Wait! Don't tell me the Resistance base is behind a waterfall!{w}{br}That's so cool!{w};auto

u;Ophie;MidRight
s;Ophie;Don't you want to see what's up?{w};auto
s;Joel;That sounds... dangerous.{w}{br}I reckon we should do the smart thing and walk around the fighting.{w};auto
s;Ophie;I thought you two were freedom fighters, not cowards.{w};auto
s;Joel;Lad, don't test me.{w};auto
s;Prim;Ophie's right. Someone could be in trouble...{w};auto
