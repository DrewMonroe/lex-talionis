s;Althea;Thanks for rescuing us!{w}{br}I don't think we would've survived otherwise.{w};auto
s;Drake;My sincerest apologies.{w}{br}I am ever in your debt.{w};auto
s;Prim;Don't mention it.{w}{br}We Keralans have to help each other in these troubled times.{w};auto
s;Althea;That's a pleasant philosophy.{w};auto
s;Prim;...{w};auto
s;Althea;I mean it. Honest!{w}{br}If everyone lived that way, the world would be a much better place.{w};auto
s;Prim;No, I didn't mean to question your honesty...{w}{br}It's just, I recognize you from somewhere.{w}{br}But I could swear I've never met you.{w};auto
s;Althea;Oh. It's probably nothing to fret yourself over.{w};auto
s;Prim;Oh, now I remember!{w}{br}Your picture was carved on the Lion's Wall at the monastery!{w};auto
s;Ophie;How is that possible, Prim?{w}{br}That carving has to be decades old...{w}{br}And anyway, Master Yohn said everyone on that wall died in the Empire's purge.{w};auto
s;Althea;...Your master was correct.{w}{br}They are all dead.{w};auto
s;Drake;I think you've said enough.{w}{br}Thank you for the help, but you're upsetting my lady.{w};auto
s;Prim;Oh, I'm sorry--{w};auto
s;Althea;No, Drake. I can handle myself.{w}{br}...That's my mother you recognize.{w};auto
s;Prim;The queen? You're the queen's daughter?{w};auto
s;Ophie;I was told all of the royalty were executed after the invasion.{w};auto
s;Althea;They were, except me.{w}{br}Drake and I managed to escape.{w}{br}...I, alone among my siblings, survived the purge, for all the good that's done.{w}{br}Drake and I have been on the run ever since.{w};auto
s;Ophie;So you're the one the Archon's been looking for!{w}{br}You're the fugitive!{w};auto
s;Drake;Yes. Capturing Princess Althea would finalize the Empire's hold on Kerala.{w};auto
s;Ophie;Well then, we can't let them capture you!{w}{br}You should come with us.{w}{br}We'll get you to the Resistance base.{w};auto
s;Althea;The Resistance base?{w};auto
s;Ophie;Yeah! It's gotta be the safest place in all of Kerala right now.{w};auto
s;Althea;Hmmm....{w};auto
s;Drake;If they're telling the truth, milady,{w}{br}it would mean an end to all this running.{w};auto 
s;Althea;If they're telling the truth,{w}{br}then they're our only hope.{w}{br}I'll trust your word, um...{w};auto
s;Ophie;Oh, sorry, your highness.{w}{br}I'm Ophie and this is Prim.{w};auto
s;Prim;It's an honor to meet you, princess Althea.{w};auto
s;Althea;Please, don't be so formal.{w}{br}I can't convince Drake to refer to me as Althea,{w}{br}but I couldn't bear to have anyone else be so stiff.{w};auto 
s;Ophie;Will do, Althea!{w}{br}Then let's scram, before any more Imperial thugs show up.{w};auto
