u;Ophie;Right
s;Ophie;Just like Sam said, the guards are leaving...{w};auto
u;Joel;Left
s;Joel;I reckon' we'd best make this quick.{w}{br}Who knows how long they'll be.{w};auto
r;Ophie
u;Renae;Right
s;Renae;Oh, you can count on me to make this quick.{w}{br}They don't call me the best thief in Kerala for nothing.{w};auto
r;Joel
u;Theo;Left
s;Theo;I doubt that anybody refers to you as that, Renae.{w};auto
s;Renae;They sure do.{w}{br}You probably just haven't heard them.{w}{br}Really, you need to get out more, Theo.{w};auto
s;Theo;In fact,{w}{br}wouldn't being called the best thief in Kerala implicitly falsify that statement?{w};auto
s;Renae;What now?{w};auto
s;Theo;The best thief should be sneaky, right?{w};auto
s;Renae;I am sneaky!{w};auto
s;Theo;So the best thief in Kerala should be someone nobody knows about...{w};auto
s;Renae;Yet, here I am, living proof!{w}{br}La-dee-da!{w};auto
s;Theo;...Theo, ol' chap, why do you even try...{w};auto;thought_bubble

u;Joel;MidLeft
u;Ophie;FarRight
s;Ophie;So why isn't Sam with us?{w};auto
u;Renae;MidRight
s;Renae;He thinks he's above us.{w};auto
u;Theo;FarLeft
s;Theo;Renae! Don't be so unkind.{w};auto
s;Renae;What! I'm just speaking the truth.{w}{br}You'd think someone who calls himself our leader would actually be here...{w};auto 
s;Theo;Sam is a tactician and a healer, not a fighter.{w}{br}He probably just wants some time to be alone and plan the Resistance's next move.{w}{br}I know I would...{w};auto
s;Joel;He has been more secretive lately.{w}{br}With all this talk of his sources...{w};auto
r;Renae;Theo
u;Prim;MidRight
s;Prim;Most of the guards have left.{w};auto
s;Joel;Then now's the time to strike.{w}{br}I reckon' we've got less than half an hour.{w};auto
s;Ophie;Alright! Let's go!{w};auto
