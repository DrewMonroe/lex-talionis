u;Sam;FarRight
s;Sam;Gather round everyone.{w}{br}I have an important announcement to make...{w};auto
u;Joel;FarLeft
u;Renae;MidLeft
s;Joel;Uh-oh. Important announcements are never good news.{w};auto
s;Sam;Actually, Joel, this is good news.{w}{br}I hope everyone present had a restful sleep, because it may be your last for a while.{w};auto
s;Joel;How's that good news, boss?{w}{br}No sleep!?{w};auto
s;Renae;Joel, let the man speak.{w};auto
s;Joel;Right, right.{w}{br}Carry on, Sam.{w};auto
s;Sam;Kayla, Theo, and I have spent the last few days decrypting the Empire's code... {w}{br}Now, getting the information out from that tome was not easy.{w}{br}All the data was encrypted with a...{w}{br}Well, actually, it was a variant of an advanced Vigarde cipher, really quite something--{w};auto
s;Renae;What was in the code!?{w}{br}What did you find!{w};auto
s;Sam;Right... Well...{w}{br}let's just say our timetable's been moved up.{w};auto
r;Joel
u;Althea;FarLeft
s;Althea;Our timetable?{w};auto
s;Sam;For putting you on the throne.{w};auto
r;Renae
u;Ophie;MidLeft
s;Ophie;No more beating around the bush.{w}{br}What did you discover?{w};auto
s;Sam;There was a treasure trove of information in that tome.{w}{br}It's no wonder the Empire went to such great lengths to protect it.{w}{br}Kayla, why don't you explain it?{w};auto
u;Kayla;MidRight
s;Kayla;My pleasure, Sam.{w}{br}The Confederacy has reinforced their northern front.{w}{br}We were hoping to force the Empire to commit some of their own armies there as well.{w}{br}However, we didn't expect the Empire to react so strongly.{w};auto
s;Althea;They're attacking the Confederacy directly!?{w};auto
s;Kayla;Tsk Tsk. Even the Empire would not be so bold, Althea.{w}{br}However, the Empress has commandeered nearly four-fifths of Archon Ulver's army.{w}{br}They are to reinforce that front.{w};auto
s;Ophie;So that leaves Archon Ulver's force in Rajas... {w};auto
s;Kayla;Very, very weak.{w};auto
s;Ophie;When does Ulver's army leave?{w};auto
s;Kayla;They've already started.{w};auto
s;Ophie;...Ulver's guard is down.{w};auto
s;Kayla;Right.{w}{clear}Unfortunately, we can only take advantage of this weakness for a short period of time.{w}{br}Another army of recruits from the Imperial heartlands will reinforce Ulver soon.{w};auto
s;Sam;We only have three days before the new army arrives,{w}{br}if they're not held up on their march.{w};auto
s;Ophie;So, what's our plan?{w};auto
s;Sam;Simply put, we finish this.{w}{br}We take back Kerala.{w}{br}We put Althea on the Lion Throne.{w}{br}We take this chance, because we may never get another.{w}{br}With the Imperial army weakened, we can attack Rajas directly.{w}{br}Kiley's army assaults the front gates, along with a host of loyalists.{w}{br}In the meantime, we sneak into the Sun Palace and capture Archon Ulver,{w}{br}cutting the Imperial head off the proverbial snake.{w}{br}With their leader deposed, the remaining Imperials should be easily routed.{w};auto
s;Ophie;Then Althea can take the throne.{w}{br}Kerala will be free of foreign rule.{w};auto
s;Sam;And we'll have the Confederacy's support.{w}{br}We'll announce Althea's presence after our victory.{w}{br}She looks just like her mother, so there should be little doubt that she's no pretender.{w}{br}The Empire will be unlikely to challenge us with the Confederacy openly backing us,{w}{br}and we'll have the support of all of Kerala.{w};auto
r;Althea;Kayla
u;Joel;FarLeft
s;Joel;That's quite the ambitious plan, Sam...{w};auto
s;Sam;Another opportunity like this may not come again...{w}{br}Is everyone prepared to do this?{w};auto
s;Ophie;I sure am!{w};auto
r;Ophie
u;Prim;MidLeft
s;Sam;Prim?{w};auto
s;Prim;Anything that will help the Keralan people.{w};auto
s;Sam;Joel?{w};auto
s;Joel;Aye. Count me in, chief.{w};auto
r;Prim
u;Eliza;MidLeft
s;Sam;Eliza?{w};auto
s;Eliza;I didn't tag along with you lot this long just to drop out now...{w};auto
r;Eliza;Joel
u;Kayla;Left
s;Sam;Kayla?{w};auto
s;Kayla;Tsk Tsk, Sam. Anything for you, dearest.{w}{br}Plus, if we succeed here, well, I'll get a fantastic promotion!{w};auto
r;Kayla
u;Theo;Left
s;Sam;Theo?{w};auto
s;Theo;If my expertise is required...{w};auto
r;Theo
u;Drake;MidLeft
u;Althea;FarLeft
s;Sam;Althea?{w};auto
s;Althea;Uh... I guess?{w};auto
s;Sam;Is something wrong, Althea?{w};auto
s;Althea;No, no...{w}{br}We should restore Kerala's independance!{w};auto
s;Sam;Ok... Drake?{w};auto
s;Drake;It would be my honor to return Althea to her rightful station as queen.{w};auto
r;Althea;Drake
u;Renae;Left
s;Sam;Renae?{w};auto
s;Renae;Huh? Oh yeah!{w};auto
r;Renae
u;Nia;Left
s;Sam;Nia?{w};auto
s;Nia;...{w};auto
r;Nia
s;Sam;Perfect. Then we're all in agreement.{w}{br}Coyote has already been sent to tell Kiley the news...{w};auto
u;Ophie;Left
s;Ophie;What are we waiting for!{w}{br}We need to prepare!{w};auto
s;Sam;Right. Everyone, this meeting is adjourned.{w}{br}Get ready. We strike at dawn tomorrow.{w};auto
