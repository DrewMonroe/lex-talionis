# UnitLevel.txt is used to define what units will be part of this level; and where they will spawn
# 
# Each unit belongs on its own line
# Syntax:
# team; savedunit; event_id; unit_id; position; ai
# - OR -
# team; savedunit; event_id; class; level; items; position; ai; name; faction; desc
# 
# savedunit refers to whether the unit should be loaded from a previous level (ie player characters).
# event_id gives the unit a unique id that other scripts use. The unit will not start on the battlefield unless event_id = 0.
# unit_id refers to what kind of unit to load from the data.xml files
# position should be formatted like #,#
# ai refers to what kind of AI the unit should possess.
