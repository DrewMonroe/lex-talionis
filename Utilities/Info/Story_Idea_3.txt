In the City, they fight Locke's army. (20)

There's actually 2 rituals (3 kings for unsealing gate). And The Waif bangs on the door.
No closer, or the waif dies. You'd kill her anyway. No, she was but a first attempt. Why would I kill her out of hand. I want no more death here than you. Please, the three of you unseal the vessel. It was sealed long ago by the blood of three kings, and can only be opened the same way. I'd rather it be the living blood. No, there must be a good reason for it to be sealed. They didn't know what they were dealing with. I do. I can release the gate. The dead can come back.
No, it doesn't work. They tried in Umbria. She came back, but she wasn't the same...
Of course not. The gate was still sealed. Now, girl, shudder. She shudders and the gates swing open. 
The gate is opened and Locke's wife comes out. But she's not right. Bert. Others start pouring out of the gate, and they have to seal it back up by spilling the blood of three kings. Or destroy the gate for good. The dead and the living cannot linger, the world is now slowly dying. Locke is killed, and he and his wife disintegrate. The Rot continues, so they have to finish fast. (21)
Any of your dead units also respawn.
When they defeat it, if true ending, Waif is resurrected by life returning to the world, since she was but a vessel. If not true ending, then well, gg. Waif dies, world is still saved.

- Need to think about how seal and unseal works (Why Locke would need Kings alive, why invade, but also why he would need waif)
- Need to consider what intrigue happens to prepare the reader for Umbrian superweapon.
