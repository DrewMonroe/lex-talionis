s;Theo;Listen... It started like this.{w}{br}It was an uneventful Tuesday morning.{w}{br}I should have known something was up.{w}{br}My hangover from last night was gnashing my temples like a toothless rat on a nickel steak.{w}{br}I needed another drink.{w}{br}Or five.{w}{clear}That's when trouble walked in the door.{w};auto;noir
u;Prim;Right
s;Prim;Theo, I need your help.{w};auto
s;Theo;A blue-haired dame, looking more nervous than a spinal column.{w}{br}She was an old flame of mine who'd fallen on hard times.{w}{br}But I wasn't looking to rekindle the relationship.{w};auto;noir
s;Prim;Theo, what are you mumbling about?{w}{br}Are you alright?{w}{br}Anyways, I've lost a tome of mine...{w}{br}Have you seen it around anywhere by chance?
s;Theo;This had bad news written on it like the obituary of the morning paper.{w}{br}But Theo Sphinx, Private Eye never refuses a case, no matter how dangerous.{w};auto;noir
s;Prim;Theo?{w};auto
s;Theo;I agreed, reluctantly--{w}{br}for the sake of the past.{w};auto;noir
s;Prim;Oh you don't have to go through the trouble, I was just wondering if...{w};auto;noir
r;Prim
s;Theo;The dame prattled on, but I'd heard enough.{w}{br}I dusted off my jacket, lit up my last cigar, grabbed my hat and walked out, the scent of one too many drinks hanging on the cheap wallpaper.{w}{br}I had a meeting with destiny, and she was a cold mistress.{w};auto;noir

s;Theo;It was what folks called the dead of winter.{w}{br}The dirt had mixed with the ice and snow until the alleys were plastered in a crunchy, gritty brown.{w}{br}A fine complement to this cold case.{w}{br}I’d just stopped off at Joel’s and ordered a good hot cup of coffee,{w}{br}when in comes a violet-haired vixen with an eerie smile--{w}{br}looking for me, as usual.{w};auto;noir
u;Renae;Right
s;Renae;I heard you wanted to talk to me, Theo?{w}{br}What's up?{w};auto
s;Theo;I had little to go on, but this dame was my first lead.{w}{br}She might have looked enticing, but every rose has its thorns.{w}{br}Stolen many a bloke's heart--{w}{br}along with his money. She'd supposedly reformed, but I had my doubts.{w}{br}I asked her if she'd been around O'Halley's street anytime lately.{w}{br}Maybe the temptation of her past had proven too great?{w};auto;noir
s;Renae;What are you talking about, Theo?{w}{br}O'Halley Street?{w};auto
s;Theo;She tried to play dumb with me, but I wasn't buying it.{w}{br}I'd seen her at Miss Prim's weekend galas, often through the glass of a strong scotch.{w};auto;noir
s;Renae;Oh, Prim's room? Yeah, I'd been by...{w}{br}I heard she lost one of her tomes?{w};auto
s;Theo;Finally a lead.{w}{br}I pressed her on her story.{w};auto;noir
s;Renae;What, you think I took it!{w}{br}Sure, I'm a thief, but I don't steal from the Resistance, Theo!{w}{br}You've got to know that by now.{w}{br}Sure there have been exceptions, but, trust me, I'm not the culprit.{w}{br}Maybe Sam knows?{w}{br}He's always keeping tabs on us.{w};auto
r;Renae
s;Theo;She made like a skydiver with a broken parachute and hit the road, leaving me to my thoughts.{w}{br}This case was a real stumper.{w}{br}But I knew who to turn to next, an old friend on the force who might have some answers...{w};auto;noir

s;TheoIt was raining.{w}{br}Hard, drumming, pounding rain.{w}{br}The kind of rain you’d hope would clean the filth right off the streets.{w}{br}Sam "Snake Eyes" Alhara was waiting outside the station.{w}{br}Well, not all our wishes can come true.{w};auto;noir
u;Sam;Right
s;Sam;What is it Theo?{w}{br}I'm kind of busy here...{w}{br}Our next raid is quite important.{w};auto
s;Theo;Sam was a cool customer, with a face made for radio.{w}{br}An old partner of mine, but we'd drifted apart since I left the force.{w}{br}Too bad he was my only lead on this one.{w};auto;noir
s;Sam;Prim's missing tome?{w}{br}Really, Theo?{w}{br}Don't you think this could wait?{w};auto
s;Theo;I could tell he was hiding something.{w}{br}Sam's not the kind of guy who'd give up the chance to prove himself to the force.{w}{br}Kissing the commissioner's ass was half his job description these days.{w};auto;noir
s;Sam;Well, maybe the Empire's managed to infiltrate us after all?{w}{br}This isn't good...{w};auto
s;Theo;Please. Don't make me laugh. {w};auto
s;Theo;You'd have figured Sam would have some smarts, since he surely hadn't graduated the academy on his looks.{w};auto 
s;Theo;This is not the way the Empire would've done it.{w}{br}It was somebody on the inside, Sam!{w};auto
s;Sam;But, who would've taken Prim's tome...{w}{br}Did you talk to Renae?{w}{br}Or you could try Nia, she's pretty perceptive, if you can get her to talk.{w}{br}Anyways, I've got work to do...{w};auto
r;Sam
s;Theo;Clearly, Sam was not going to be any more help.{w}{br}He didn't know a thing--{w}{br}no surprise.{w}{br}After I roughed him up a bit, he made like a rat on a sinking ship and bailed.{w}{br}But I had one more lead, and I was going to make it count.{w};auto;noir

s;Theo;Snow.{w}{br}Since when the hell did it snow around here?{w}{br}And it was coming down in buckets.{w}{clear}So this was it, my last lead in this godforsaken case.{w}{br}The hour crawled by like a sick cockroach.{w}{br}I'd almost given up hope when out of the dark strutted a raven-haired dame with a wild glint in her eyes.{w}{br}Before she could scamper off, I cornered her.{w};auto;noir
u;Nia;Right
move_sprite;Theo;24,0
s;Nia;...{w};auto
s;Theo;She looked tenser than a minister in a ten-cent whorehouse.{w}{br}I asked her if she'd heard anything about Miss Prim's problem.{w}{br}She shook her head, but I wasn't having it.{w}{br}I grabbed her by the collar and demanded the truth about Miss Prim's missing tome--{w}{br}I've still got the scratches to prove it.{w}{br}To my surprise, her expression softened.{w}{br}She beckoned me down 79th street and I followed.{w}{br}After what seemed like a dozen twists and turns through this concrete jungle,{w}{br}we arrived at a run-down shack on the outskirts of the East Side.{w};auto

s;Nia;...{w};auto;noir
r;Nia
s;Theo;Nia didn't mince words.{w}{br}But I could tell something was going to be finished once I walked in that door--{w}{br}either this case, or me.{w}{br}The dame made like a banana and split,{w}{br}while I holstered my gun and made my way inside.{w}{clear}I was ready for answers.{w};auto;noir
u;Kayla;Right
s;Kayla;Tsk Tsk. So you've finally arrived, Theo.{w}{br}I was wondering if you'd ever manage to track me down.{w}{br}How'd you find the place?{w};auto
s;Theo;The silver-haired dame was all business.{w};auto;noir
s;Kayla;No, don't tell me, Nia told you.{w}{br}That girl!{w};auto
s;Theo;Your game is up, Kayla.{w}{br}Hand over the tome.{w};auto
s;Theo;Sad to see such a pretty girl turning herself to a life a crime.{w};auto;noir
s;Kayla;The tome, what?{w};auto
s;Theo;She wasn't making this any easier on herself.{w};auto;noir 
s;Theo;Don't play dumb with me, Kayla. Prim's tome!{w};auto
s;Kayla;Hah. You're a bit late on the uptake, Theo.{w}{br}I've already turned Prim's tome into something much grander!{w}{br}Look at this!{w};auto
give_item;Theo;Howl
s;Theo;With something like that in her possession,{w}{br}the dame was obviously connected to somebody up high, but I had a job to finish.{w}{br}Though she tried to fight back, I cuffed her and brought her back to the station.{w};auto;noir
r;Kayla
s;Theo;This was on Sam's plate now.{w}{br}Too bad about Miss Prim's tome...{w}{br}but my job here was done.{w}{br}Another case closed by Private Eye Theo Sphinx.{w};auto;noir
