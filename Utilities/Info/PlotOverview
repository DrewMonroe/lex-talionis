Need to include Demons (Nature)
Long ago, six nature gods roamed this land. But prideful humans sages rose up and cast aside the gods, trapping their souls in stones, which also powers the choir.
Need to have a reason Marduk wants to acquire all the souls. 
The Six Nations kill Orson because he killed their own. Jealousy. But also at Marduk's prodding. Marduk believes a war would cause enough confusion for him to steal Soul of Spring. He wants to resurrect the gods.
Sam goes out and gets revenge on the Five for killing his own.
So, Prim? Just a normal oracle...
So Marduk goes around trying to resurrect the gods. We were never meant to rule this land. Creatures of nature.
When you reach Marduk, he has reassembled the six stones and started the ritual. If you succeed in killing him and stopping the ritual, the gods are kept in stasis.
