Current Setup: 
4 Melee Weapons: Swords, Lances, Axes, Bows
S > A > L > S
Staves (of which other weapon types can resemble staffs)
5 Magic Weapons: Wind, Fire, Thunder, Light, Dark
L > D > (W > T > F > W) > L

Change to:
4 Mostly Melee Weapons: Swords, Lances, Axes, Bows
S > A > L > S
2 Magic Weapons: Light, Dark

Advantages to changing
Current Magic Weapon Triangle is arbitrary and complicated, while the L > D > A > L is easy to remember, the inner Anima trinity is complicated.
Why are staffs by themselves when other weapon types can also be staves?
New system simplifies weapon types into essential duality of magic (Light/Dark, Order/Chaos, Artifice/Nature, Divine/Arcane, etc.)
Less weapon types mean hybrid weapons have a chance to shine.
Makes no sense to have a Bolt Axe without it being Axe Thunder, but then it can't be used by hardly anyone.
Difficult to differentiate between 5 different kinds of magic.
2 magic types means one is light and fast and one can be heavy and strong.
This duality also fits into the Lore of the world, since magic is truly just effecting control over the Aurora.
Same type magics are bad against one another, since they are both trying to do the same thing
Different type magics are strong versus one another, like magnets.
Allows me to make different classes that use the same magic weapon, like Mercenary, Myrmidon, Crusader but for magic
Instead of having one class for each type of magic.
