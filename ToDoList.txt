--- MAP ---
- Autotiles for chasm in level 6?
--- AI ---
- Add support for summons (just append summons to end of ai_list.)
- Have AI actually test equip items when making calculations ++ (not really important, since so few weapons give statuses..., could do it only if weapon has a status_equip?)

- Red highlight appears over position of last enemy fought while using 'other' team AI

- Add Decals and Colors to Info Menus... ??** -- Update Info Menu to match Sacred Stones?
