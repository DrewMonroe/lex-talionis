ToDo:
- General Testing

-- KNOWN ISSUES:
- Music may not work on or even crash Mac's with El Capitan update (AudioComponent.h error in El Capitan mac)
- Avast Antivirus or other antiviruses may slow down certain actions that write to disk. Known issue with Avast Antivirus Behaviour Shield and exiting the game.

FOR FUTURE UPDATES TO THE ENGINE:
--- MAPMOVES ---
- Have units keep their possible moves in memory... (may not be needed) ?? -- Is currently fast
--- L Button ---
- Add L button support to different states -- which ones?
--- COMBAT ---
- Full Combat Animations
- Add button to hold to toggle between full combat animations (Add speed up button also... (skip button is START)) (AUX, INFO, BACK, SELECT are all available)
- Add screenshake etc on skill uses?? -- certain skills only - Metamagic, Critical, Sol, Luna
--- MAP ---
- Autotiles for chasm in level 6?
--- CUSTOMIZATION ---
- Add ability to select at beginning of new game. (Make it a state, like battle_save), CASUAL/HYBRID(lose stats/levels?)/CLASSIC, NORMAL/HARD (LEVEL OF HARD), FIXED/RANDOM/HYBRID, RNG: 1, 2, 3, INFINITE (Selection 49 default), Skill*Str always hit -- Would need to make these saved in gameStateObj or optionStateObj or something similar.
--- AI ---
- Add support for summons (just append summons to end of ai_list.)
- Have AI actually test equip items when making calculations ++ (not really important, since so few weapons give statuses..., could do it only if weapon has a status_equip?)
- Consider moving Recovery AI into main attack AI?? - maybe not
- Add custom AI for activated skills, if necessary (hook it onto the custom AI for spells)
- Red highlight appears over position of last enemy fought while using 'other' team AI
- Add threading to AI - stick it on a separate thread - won't actually help much since Python's threading is kind of fake?
--- DIALOGUE ---
- Add Visual Novel like dialogue backlog...??** On R press
--- LEVEL UP ---
- Have Level up! match the way its done in fe7... (sound)
- Improve Promotion... Add animation. Make sure exp works correctly.
--- PICTURES --- 
- Wagon Class Card
--- MUSIC ---
- Have Music Crossfade? -- Not possible with Pygame (SDL_mixer)! only one streamed music channel at a time :(
--- GUI ---
- Add cursor scroll to menus (Choice Menu), so you can just hold down the direction you want to go. ++
--- AWAKENING UI ---
- Awakening style attack unit, then item, rather than the opposite (option) (Use L to cycle through available weapons)
- Transparent dude moves with arrow
- Pulsing arrow (transparency and color)
- Allow user to control arrow movement (option)
- Allow quick attack on enemy, quick spell on ally (option)
--- EXTRA ---
- Names for chapters??
- Unit Menu ++
- Write a tutorial on how to use Lex Talionis Engine (Make Sacred Stones Chapter 1) ++
- Color blind mode ++ Allow switching of tile and unit colors (blue, red, green, yellow, purple, white, orange)
- Add Decals and Colors to Info Menus... ??** -- Update Info Menu to match Sacred Stones?
- Build a GUI that builds levels... Unit Placement, TileInfo placement
- Keep gameStateObj.allunits sorted by unit_id? (what is it currently sorted by?) (makes get unit by id faster. But its not that slow to begin with...)
- Add Rescue/Warp/Rewarp handling (would include ability to select starting and ending positions - would allow time for warp animation) (both as staff and as ability)
- Add correct warp animation
- Add Fake arrival to Give/Take/Shove++
- Scenic Maps (UnitLevel rework?) (Don't need to put previous saved units in UnitLevel.txt manually) (maybe have a load unit command? then a place loaded_units command?)++
- Convert some of the very slow stuff (line of sight, AStar, Djikstra's) to a C module to make it faster.++
- Consider upping effects of weapon triangle over time
- D: 15 hit, 1 damage
- C: 20 hit, 1 damage
- B: 20 hit, 2 damage
- A: 25 hit, 2 damage
- If you are on impassable terrain, take damage.
- Add levelup quotes - optional - Because characters don't really matter for this game, probably not
- Add Turnwheel
